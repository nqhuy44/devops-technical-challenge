# DevOps coding assessment

## Dear Candidate
Welcome to our take-home coding assessment. We trust you'll find this assessment both challenging and rewarding, and we look forward to the opportunity to discuss your accomplishments further in the next stage.

## Your Challenge
Develop an Infrastructure as Code solution for deploying a scalable web application stack consisting of containerized components:

1. **_Web Server:_** Containerized Any HTTP Server (eg. node.js)
2. **_Database Server:_** Containerized MySQL or any NoSQL
3. **_Application Server:_** Containerized lightweight Python or Node.js application

## Requirements:
- Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to manage your codebase.
- Utilize a container orchestration tool (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm) for managing the containerized infrastructure.
- Implement infrastructure provisioning using a cloud provider of your choice (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) or a local virtualization tool (e.g., Minikube, Docker Desktop).
- Ensure the solution is modular, scalable, and easily configurable for different levels of load and traffic.
- Include appropriate security measures in your containerized infrastructure setup.
- Implement auto-scaling capabilities for handling increased demand on the web application.
- Use best practices for containerization, including Dockerfile optimization and container image management.
- Ensure proper networking setup for communication between containers and external traffic.
- Use Infrastructure as Code principles for managing container configurations and deployments.

## Deliverables:
- Infrastructure as Code scripts or configuration files for provisioning the containerized web application stack.
- README.md file providing instructions on how to:
    1. Set up and configure the containerized infrastructure.
    2. Deploy the containerized web application stack.
    3. Any additional considerations or notes related to containerization and scalability.

## Bonus (Optional):
- Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, building, and deploying the containerized web application stack.
- Integrate logging and monitoring solutions specifically tailored for containerized environments.
- Utilize container registry services for managing container images.
- Implement blue-green or canary deployment strategies for rolling out updates.

## How to submit your work
- Start by creating a new Git repository on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket (all the code is your IP)
- Share the public git repository URL that holds all your work

## Evaluation Criteria:
- Adherence to requirements and best practices for containerization and Infrastructure as Code.
- Clarity, readability, and organization of code.
- Robustness and scalability of the containerized infrastructure setup.
- Security measures implemented for containerized environments.
- Documentation quality.
- Use of automation and tooling for container management and scaling.

## Recommendations
- Read the features and the bonus features carefully before you start coding
- Committing changes at appropriate intervals in Git
- Leave TODO in the code if you couldn't finish a solution, you have chance to explain it during the interview

## Interview process
- You have 4 days to complete the assessment. We know everyone is busy, so if you need one more day let us know.
- During the interview you need to explain and demonstrate the code via the feature requirements
